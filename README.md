# Koala - Web Engineering Challenge

### The Backstory...
A high-profile client has hired your company to build a countdown clock web app to help them keep track of an internal deadline. Since this deadline keeps changing, the countdown must be able to be reset and adjusted as necessary.

The original developer tasked with building the app was too distracted watching episodes of Selling Sunset to pay attention to code quality, deadlines, or architectural best practices. It's unclear if the codebase even compiles. In a panic, your company has tasked you with both finishing the app and ensuring the code adheres to your own personal engineering standards.

### Requirements
We have intentionally kept this assignment open-ended, but here are the minimum requirements:

- There must be an input that takes a number or set of numbers that can be used to set and reset a countdown timer.
- To us, code quality is just as important as feature execution. Without being prescriptive, any decisions you make to refactor, test, style, or fix anything in the existing code are just as important as successfully building the countdown itself.

### Notes
- The codebase is intentionally sloppy. We want to encourage you to change any if not all of it as you see fit.
- We've connected the app to an API call that returns a configuration JSON. As you work on the app, we encourage you to use this data to help inform your styling.
- There is no limit to the scope of this project. Creativity, critical thinking, and an eye for stability and extensibility are paramount to the culture here at Koala.
- Enjoy yourself. We want you to show off. Make up requirements and solve problems we haven't asked you to solve if you think they'd be exciting to build. We want to see from you a genuine passion and a love of the craft.

### Dependencies
This codebase uses React, Typescript, and Styled Components as they are the primary dependencies used by the Koala frontends. Though you may change any existing code as you see fit, we ask that you do not change these dependencies (i.e. rewriting the app in Angular). However, feel free to add any additional dependencies as you see fit.

### Installation

1. Install [`Yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

2. Install the project dependencies:
